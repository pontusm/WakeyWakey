#WakeyWakey

WakeyWakey is a small web application that lets you send wake-on-lan and ping signals
to remote computers. The main purpose is to provide an easy way to wake up computers
on a local network.

At work we usually have our desktop computers go into standby mode after a few hours
of inactivity. This is a good thing to save energy. However, sometimes you need to
connect to your computer remotely but it is sleeping. What to do?

This is where WakeyWakey can help. By installing WakeyWakey on one of the servers in
your network (you have some servers right?) that is running 24 hrs a day you can just
go to WakeyWakey on that server and send a signal to wake up your work computer.

But...Why do we need an application like this? Can't we just send a wake-on-lan signal
over the internet? Yes, we can but it is notoriously error prone since many routers
simply filter out the magic packets. The most reliable technique I have found is to
have one computer on the inside that can send the wake-on-lan signal to the computer
you want to wake up. That has worked really well for me.
